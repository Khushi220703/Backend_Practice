// Directory Watcher with Backup and Notification
// â€¢ Create a system that watches a directory for changes using fs.watch. When a file is added, modified, or 
// deleted, back up the file (or delete it from the backup if removed), and notify a user via an HTTP request sent to a specified endpoint.
