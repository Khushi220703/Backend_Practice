// Ques11. File Upload Server with Path Validation
// Create an HTTP server that allows users to upload files.
// The server should validate the file path using the path module to ensure that the file is saved within a specific directory (e.g., /uploads).
// If the file's path is outside the permitted directory, reject the upload.
