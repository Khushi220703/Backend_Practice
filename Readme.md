create a file named system_info.txt inside that directory. The file should contain details
of the users home directory, total system mem and platform.

Ques2: Create a NodeJS script that reads a given directory's contents, filters out only .txt files, moves 
them into a new directory called txt_files using a path module to construct path


Ques3: Write a Node.js script that accepts a filename as input, checks if the file exists in the current 
working directory using the fs module, and if it exists, prints its full absolute path using the path module. 
If the file doesn't exist, create it.
